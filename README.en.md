# Network technologies labs
This labs for improve your skills in network technologies. For this moment I share labs on the topics of ICND2 course (200-105).

Labs description taken from [Cisco CCNA Lab Guide, Neil Anderson](https://www.flackbox.com/)

All of this labs are successfully completed in [EVE-NG](https://www.eve-ng.net/), hosted in Google Cloud. Internet have many manuals about cdeploy EVE-NG in cloud providers, for example [1](https://showipintbri.blogspot.com/2018/08/eve-ng-in-cloud.html), [2](http://ithitman.blogspot.com/2018/04/configuring-eve-ng-on-google-compute.html).
My Google Cloud instance parameters: `n1-highmem-2 (2 virtual CPU, 13 GB RAM)`

Labs in `.zip` files. Filename contains vendorname on whose equipment a lab is made. Now (02 aug 2019) it's Cisco only. I'm plan to remake all labs with Mikrotik with RouterOS's particular features. But now I don't know exact date.
